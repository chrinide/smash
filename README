  About SMASH
  -----------
    Scalable Molecular Analysis Solver for High-performance computing (SMASH)
  is open-source software for massively parallel quantum chemistry calculations.
    It is currently capable of energy, analytical gradient, and
  geometry optimization calculations of Hartree-Fock theory and 
  Density Functional Theory (DFT), and energy calculations of 
  Second-order Moller-Plesset (MP2) perturbation theory. DFT 
  calculations can be performed on 100,000 CPU cores of K Computer
  with high parallel efficiency.
     The Fortran 90/95 language is used with MPI and OpenMP for
  inter-node and intra-node parallelization, respectively.
  Supported platforms are x86-64/Linux with Intel or GNU compilers,
  and K Computer and FX10 with Fujitsu compiler.
  SMASH is developed and distributed under the Apache License 2.0.
