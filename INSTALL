  SMASH INSTALLATION OVERVIEW
  ---------------------------
  If your machine is not a x86-64/Linux system or does not include
  an MPI library, choose an appropriate Makefile. Make sure that
  the compiler and library in the Makefile are correct, and then
  type the following command to build SMASH.

    (x86-64 with MPI)
      $ make

    (x86-64 without MPI)
      $ make -f Makefile.x86.noMPI

    (K Computer or FX10 with MPI)
      $ make -f Makefile.fujitsu

  If it is successfully completed, you can find the bin/smash file.
