{"name":"SMASH","tagline":"Massively parallel software for quantum chemistry calculations ","body":"### Welcome to SMASH Pages.\r\n  Scalable Molecular Analysis Solver for High-performance computing systems (SMASH) is open-source software for massively parallel quantum chemistry calculations. It is currently capable of energy, analytical gradient, and geometry optimization calculations of Hartree-Fock theory and Density Functional Theory (DFT), and energy calculations of Second-order Moller-Plesset (MP2) perturbation theory. DFT calculations can be performed on 100,000 CPU cores of K Computer with high parallel efficiency.\r\n  The Fortran 90/95 language is used with MPI and OpenMP for inter-node and intra-node parallelization, respectively. Supported platforms are x86-64/Linux with Intel or GNU compilers, and K Computer and FX10 with Fujitsu compiler. SMASH is developed and distributed under the Apache License 2.0.\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ cd your_repo_root/repo_name\r\n$ git fetch origin\r\n$ git checkout gh-pages\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you're using the GitHub for Mac, simply sync your repository and you'll see the new branch.\r\n\r\n### Designer Templates\r\nWe've crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and continue to layouts to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved if it remained markdown format.\r\n\r\n### Rather Drive Stick?\r\nIf you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator written by our own Tom Preston-Werner. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nKazuya Ishimura (@ishimura-smash)\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with SMASH?
